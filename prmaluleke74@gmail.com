# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:Software engineering involves a more structured and organized software development process that includesÂ requirements engineering, design, coding, testing, and maintenance. In contrast, software development may be a less structured process that involves writing code, testing, and deploying the software

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach, where requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams. Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach, where each phase of the project must be completed before moving on to the next phase.
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:Consider Agile if your project has dynamic requirements, needs frequent client feedback, and values adaptability. Choose Waterfall for projects with well-defined requirements, limited client involvement during development, and where a structured approach is necessary.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?involves tasks such as requirement analysis, elicitation, documentation, conciliation, and validation.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:Modularity in software design is a technique where complex software is divided into smaller, independent modules, such as functions, classes, or components.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:Unit Testing.

Integration Testing.

System Testing.

Acceptance Testing.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database . If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:Managing people: Acts as a project leader. Communication with stakeholders. Manages human resources.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:the process of changing , modifying and updating software to keep up with customer needs. Software maintenance is done after the product has launched for several reasons including improving the software overall, correcting issues or bugs, to boost performance, and more.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?the process of changing , modifying and updating software to keep up with customer needs. Software maintenance is done after the product has launched for several reasons including improving the software overall, correcting issues or bugs, to boost performance, and more
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
